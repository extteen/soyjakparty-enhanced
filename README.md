## Features & Improvements

### Posting & Reply Box Utilities

* **Soymoji Window:** A dedicated window for easily browsing and inserting **Soymojis** into your post.
* **Text Formatting Window:** Access a labeled window of available **sharty fonts**, basic formatting options, and complex combinations. This includes miscellaneous symbols like **Ϫ**, SoyBooru embedding or quoting characters (`>`,`<`,`^`).
* **Preview of Text Formatting:** A button that displays an overlay showing exactly how your text and Soymojis will look upon posting.
    * *Optional:* Includes a **Character and Line Counter** inside the preview button, keeping track of the content in your `#body`.
* **Email Options List:** A drop-down menu attached to the email field with quick-select options: **BUMP!**, **SAGE!**, **SUPERSAGE!**, **Anonymous**, **Anonymous SAGE!**, **Nonoko**, and a `(none)` option to clear the field.
* **SoyBooru Search Window:** An interface for **SoyBooru browsing**. You can either view results directly within the window or simplify the process to immediately open a new tab with your tag results.

### SPE Menu Enhancements and Configurable Options

* **World Clocks and Activity:** Displays clocks for various world regions with an estimation of **user activity** underneath.
* **Sound Notifications for Inactive Tabs:** Get audio alerts when a new reply is detected in an open thread. **5 pre-loaded sounds** are included and **custom sound uploads** are supported.
* **Custom Backgrounds:** Upload your own image to set a **custom background** that applies to every page on the site.
* **Re-added GCP Dot:** Enable or disable the **GCP dot** in the top-left corner.
* **Custom Header Links:** Add your own **custom board links** (e.g., `/gem/` or any other hidden board) directly to the boards header.
* **Theme Adaptation Control:** SPE attempts to adapt its style to your chosen site theme. If readability is compromised, there is an option to **revert to a basic style** without transparency for optimal clarity.

### Other Features

* **Advanced Soyquoting:** Replaces the standard `[Quote]` button with four smaller, precise buttons for quickly applying **`>`**, **`<`**, **`^`**, or **deleting all quotes**.
* **Admin/Mod Badges:** Adds visual badges next to the names of **Admins and Mods**, similar to the system used on the 'ki.
* **Automatic Update Checking:** The extension automatically checks GitHub for the latest SPE updates.
